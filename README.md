## Connect Four App

A simple connect four app stylized to give that nostalgic sense of playing connect four in elementary school after school programs :) 
Built with React and Redux!
Simply play as usual (be the first player with 4 of your colored checkered pieces in a consecutive sequence in a row, column or diagonal) and when someone wins, press the reset button to reset the connect four grid.
